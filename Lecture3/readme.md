# Mongoose

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library used to interact with MongoDB in Node.js applications.
It allows us to define schemas, apply validation, and perform CRUD operations in a structured way.

MongoDB → Schema-less database (no fixed structure)

Mongoose → Adds structure, rules, and safety

# process.exit()

process.exit(0) → Program exits successfully (no error)

process.exit(1) → Program exits due to error/failure

# mongoose string : minlength : [3,'minimum is 3]

# mongoose number : min : [3,'minimum is 3],
